In this folder are the files that are part of the job

The comsol file "simulations" contains the solution for the bruselator system,
a reaction-difussion system, that will be used in all programs.

The math files that allow the Fourier Analysis are arranged in each folder
of numerical solutions in the same order that they appear in the article.

Inside each folder there is a readme file that details how each calculation was made.
