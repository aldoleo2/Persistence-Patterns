In this folder you can find the files to reproduce figure 3a of the article

1. In the folders "1.769", "1.822" and "1.903" you can find the outputs from Comsol correspondent to the
   "b" value. The txt files inside this folders contain the numerical solution as a function of position and time
   for the different values of n correspondent to the name of the file.

2. In the "Fourier Coefficient for Fig 3a" Wolfram Mathematica file(.nb) we import the numerical solutions 
   from Comsol file to calculate the Fourierr Coefficients of the solutions for the different values for b and n.
 
3. This generates the files "cosT" and "sinT" which are .txt files that contain the Fourrier Coefficients
   of each solution.

4. The Wolfram Mathematica program "Figure 3a.nb" imports Fourrier Coefficients of each solution 
   to graph the fourier coefficients as a function of time
