In this folder you can find the files to reproduce figure 3b of the article

1. In the txt file "4" you can find the numerical solution as a function of position and time 
   from Comsol correspondent to the values b=1.903 and n=4. 
   
2. In the "Fourier Coefficient for Fig 3b" Wolfram Mathematica file we import this numerical solutions 
   from Comsol to calculate the Fourier Coefficients of the solutions for this values of b and n.
 
3. This generates the files "cT7" which is txt files that contain the Fourrier Coefficients
   of each solution.

4. The Wolfram Mathematica program "Figure 3b" imports this Fourrier Coefficients 
   to graph the fourier coefficients as a function of time.
