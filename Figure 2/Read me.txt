In this folder you can find the files to reproduce the figure 2 of the article

1. In the folder "1.769" you can find the outputs from comsol correspondent to the
   value b=1.769. The txt files inside this folder contain the numerical solution as a function of position and time
   for the 3 different values ​​of n correspondent to the name of the file.

2. In the "Fourier Coefficient for Fig2" Wolfram Mathematica file we import the numerical solutions 
   from Comsol to calculate the Fourierr Coefficients of the solutions for the different values of n.
 
3. This generates the files "cT3" which is a txt file that contain the Fourrier Coefficients
   of each solution.

4. The Wolfram Mathematica program "Figure 2a" imports the Fourrier Coefficients of each solution 
   to graph the fourier coefficients as a function of time
