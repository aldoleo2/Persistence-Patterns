In this folder you can find the files to reproduce figure 4 of the article

1. In the folders "1.769", "1.822" and "1.903" you can find the outputs from Comsol correspondent to each
   "b" value. The txt files inside this folders contain the numerical solution as a function of position and time
   for the different values ​​of n correspondent to the name of the file.

2. In the "Fourier Coefficient for Fig 4.nb" Wolfram Mathematica file we import the numerical solutions 
   from Comsol to calculate the Fourier Coefficients of the solutions for the different values for b and n.
 
3. This generates the files "cT3", "cT5" and "cT7" which are .txt files that contain the Fourrier Coefficients
   of each solution.

4. The Wolfram Mathematica program "Figure 4.nb" imports Fourrier Coefficients of each final solution 
   to graph the value of the biggest Fourier Coefficients as a function of n.
